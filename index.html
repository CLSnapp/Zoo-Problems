            Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are
            classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight
            species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a
            wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere
            and partially in the Southern Hemisphere.

            The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
            Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
            ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as
            one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.

            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native
            to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short,
            rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its
            tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than
            females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming
            groups called prides.

            Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the
            infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all
            animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys
            except the apes.

            An alligator, or colloquially gator, is a large reptile in the genus
            Alligator of the family Alligatoridae of the order Crocodilia. The
            two extant species are the American alligator (A. mississippiensis)
            and the Chinese alligator (A. sinensis). Additionally, several
            extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains.
